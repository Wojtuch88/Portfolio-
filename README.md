## ABOUT ME
I am a junior tester with over a year of experience! In my previous job, I didn't feel that I was using all my skills and needed a profession that would allow me to grow. **I am thirsty for knowledge and new challenges. I needed a profession that would allow me to continuously self-develop and use my talent for finding bugs. And so I found myself in a place where I chose the profession of manual tester.**

Why exactly a software tester and not something else? I can have an impact on the quality of software. **Testing is a never-ending opportunity to find typos, logical errors or functionality that could work better and easier.** Here I can show what I can afford and use my creativity. I can approach a task in a non-standard way and test the software. **As a tester, I can verify that the application works as expected by users and look at the software through its eyes.** I am also mindful of my colleagues, so I always try to write test cases and bug reports so that they are easy to understand and reproducing the steps comes easily.
During my work I have learned: **SQL**, **API**, **Chrome DevTools**, **Jira**, **Trello**, **Postman**, **GIT** and **HTML/CSS basics**.
