# :arrow_right: **ABOUT ME**

I am a junior tester with over a year of experience! In my previous job, I didn't feel that I was using all my skills and needed a profession that would allow me to grow. I am thirsty for knowledge and new challenges. I needed a profession that would allow me to continuously self-develop and use my talent for finding bugs. And so I found myself in a place where I chose the profession of manual tester.

Why exactly a software tester and not something else? I can have an impact on the quality of software. **Testing is a never-ending opportunity to find typos, logical errors or functionality that could work better and easier.** Here I can show what I can afford and use my creativity. I can approach a task in a non-standard way and test the software. **As a tester, I can verify that the application works as expected by users and look at the software through its eyes.** I am also mindful of my colleagues, so I always try to write test cases and bug reports so that they are easy to understand and reproducing the steps comes easily.
During my work I have learned: **SQL**, **API**, **Chrome DevTools**, **Jira**, **Trello**, **Postman**, **GIT** and **HTML/CSS basics**.

<b>***Benefits I learned from the course:***</b>

Understanding of software testing processes and methods.
Ability to create and execute test cases.
Develop communication skills for bug reporting and collaboration with the development team.
Prepare to work as a manual tester in various IT industries.

At the end of the course you had to pass a project to test a fake bank website. To pass the course, you had to write enough test cases, bug reports and write a test report. The passing project called Kapu$ta project is linked above in the PROJECTS section.

## :four:  7-Day Marathon HTML+CSS - GoIT

## Skills
* Figma basics
* Visual Studio Code basics
* HTML basics
* CSS styles basics
* website project with CV example

## General info
During a basic HTML and CSS course, I've learned many key skills that will allow to create a simple website. Here are some of the main topics typically covered:

### HTML:
1. **HTML document structure** – learning about the basic HTML elements, such as `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and how to structurally build a webpage.
2. **Elements and tags** – how to use tags to create headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), images (`<img>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`), tables, forms, and more.
3. **HTML attributes** – how to use attributes within tags, such as `src` in an `<img>` tag or `href` in an `<a>` tag.
4. **Forms and inputs** – how to create forms with text fields, buttons, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.

### CSS:
1. **Basic CSS styles** – learning how to add colors, fonts, backgrounds, margins, and padding.
2. **CSS selectors** – how to target elements on a page using classes, IDs, tags, and pseudo-classes.
3. **Typography** – how to manage fonts, font sizes, line height, text alignment, etc.

### Practice:
- Creating simple websites (e.g., portfolio, blog, business card website).
- Combining HTML and CSS to achieve a consistent page design.

The basic course provides a solid foundation that will allow to further explore web development and create increasingly advanced websites.
